HackBU ReadMe

Library Book Reading Schedule Calculator:

Main idea:
Calculates the amount of pages you need to read each day to finish a library book based on the amount of pages user needs to read, current day, and due date 
Would be super useful 

I originally had the idea to build this project after checking out Don Quixote from Bartle Library. Since the novel is over 1000 pages long, I needed to reassure myself that I would be able to finish the book in time before the looming due date! I am eternally grateful for the opportunity to produce this project and have it be judged at HackBU’s hackathon. This project is definitely something I would use in my daily life going forward.  :)

This project can also be easily adapted for reading assignments that students have in order to pace themselves for their assignments 

Necessary inputs:
Ask user for current date
Ask user for due date of book
Ask how many pages in the book 

Have you started the book yet?
What page are you on?
Then can calculate the amount of pages user has left to read with total pages - current page 
Do you want to pace your reading?
Implements a feature that allows the reader to spread out their reading if they don’t want to read every day until the due date 

Different name ideas:
Library book due date calculator
Library book reading schedule calculator!!

Some difficulties while coding:
Converting the inputs into integer format
Making sure the function will correctly compare the dates and calculate the days between 2 given dates 
Accounting for user error

Main goal / framework:
Need to calculate how many days between the current date and the due date of the library book 
Then divide pages / days to find how many pages they need to read each day finish by the due date
