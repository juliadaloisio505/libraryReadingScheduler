Library Book Reading Schedule Calculator:

Main idea:
Calculates the amount of pages you need to read each day to finish a library book based on the amount of pages user needs to read, current day, and due date 
Would be super useful 

I originally had the idea to build this project after checking out Don Quixote from Bartle Library. Since the novel is over 1000 pages long, I needed to reassure myself that I would be able to finish the book in time before the looming due date! This project is definitely something I will use in my daily life going forward. 

This project can also be easily adapted for reading assignments that students have in order to pace themselves for their assignments. 

Necessary inputs:
Ask user for current date
Ask user for due date of book
Ask how many pages in the book 
Have you started the book yet?
What page are you on?
Then can calculate the amount of pages user has left to read with total pages - current page 
Do you want to pace your reading?
Implements a feature that allows the reader to spread out their reading if they donâ€™t want to read every day until the due date
